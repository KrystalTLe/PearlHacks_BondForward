					<p>As an inner-city student in an impoverished area, Will was one of many young people facing an opportunity gap. Dr. Maguire became Will's mentor and they both reaped benefits of this relationship. Dr. Maguire helped Will find his passion in Data Analytics and improved his resume as well as interview skills. Will now is a SAS programmer at Box in Redwood, CA and is extremely thankful for Bond Forward.</p>
